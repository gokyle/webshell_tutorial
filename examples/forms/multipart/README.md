This is an example of using [webshell](http://go-webshell.org/) to handle
file uploads with multipart forms.

### Usage

```
$ go run server.go
```

The server will be running [localhost:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080/).

Alternatively:

```
PORT=8000 go run server.go
```

The value of `PORT` will be used to initialise the server.
