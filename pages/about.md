## About

This site serves two purposes:

0. To document and help you get started using the
[webshell](http://gokyle.github.com/webshell).
0. As the site is written in Go and uses the webshell framework, it provides
an example web app.

## What is webshell?
[webshell](http://gokyle.github.com/webshell) is a framework I've been writing
to help get started quickly when writing new webapps. This is my toolkit for
writing apps; as I find new features that I want, I add them. In the spirit
of open source, I've opened it up to the public.

## How is it licensed?
Webshell is licensed under the [ISC license](http://tyrfingr.is/licenses/LICENSE.ISC),
as is this site. The content on this site is licensed under a
